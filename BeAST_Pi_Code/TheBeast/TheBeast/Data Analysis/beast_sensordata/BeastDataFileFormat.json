/*
* High Level Example Format
* timestamp: integer [year,month,day,hour,minute,second]
* side: string // left, right
* device: 
*		name: string ["mcu","temp","imu","ppg","eeg","bioz"]
* 		status: string ["halt","sleep","active","err0","err3","err2"]
* 		data: // device dependant
* 		
* **NOTE**
* This is a basic sample of what the data will look like coming from the earpiece
* to the compute unit. This is not concrete or necessarily complete, values can be
* added, moved, changed etc.
*
* "time" - This is the timestamp from the MCU when the data was collected.
* "side" - Which earpiece the data was collected from.
* "device" - A specific class or data which is device dependant.
* 		"name" - Device label to tell the compute unit the specific sensor the data was
* 			collected from.
*		"status" - Indicates the current status of the sensor at time of collection.
*			Even if this particular sensor wasn't actively collecting data, it would
*			hold the most recent value from it's last collection. Error codes are 
*		"freq" - Current sensor sample rate.
*		"data" - This is the device specific data. These values or format can change
* 			if we need depending on serveral factors.
